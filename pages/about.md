<h3><i class="fas fa-user-tie"></i> Introduction</h3>

`As-Salamu-Alaikum(Peace be unto you)`, myself **`Shahnawaz Hossan`**. I am a passionate `Software Engineer(Full Stack)`. Currently I am working as a `Full-Stack Software Engineer` for a `Software Company`. With my dedication and hard work I want to reach the pinnacle in the development, computing and research field. That's why I always wanted to be a part of a challenging career I love.

<br/>
I used to write on different programming topics in my native language during my competitive programming. **[This](https://shahnawaz-pabon.blogspot.com/)** was my site. After starting my career, I have faced many types of problems during my development and research. That's why I started this website so that I can share those solutions of problems I faced with everyone.
